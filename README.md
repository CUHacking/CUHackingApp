## Slack bot usage

The CUSlacking bot is one of the major awesome features of this project. It
accepts two pieces of functionality:

- `cuslacking announce There's ice cream available at the ice cream tent` -
  announce the provided message on Slack and using the in-app notifications
- Reacting to a help message with üëç from a user requesting help through the app will
  match you with them and provide them with your profile picture.
