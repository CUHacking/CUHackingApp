What I did this week:
- added activities for Notifications, schedule, map, links, sponsors and request help
- updated colour scheme with CUHacking red instead of android blue

What I hope to do next week:
- add widgets with constraints to a few activities
- add icons to hamburger menu after Elisa adds it to app
- connect activities to menu and remove temp buttons after menu is added

What I struggled with:
- creating directories within the app to be more organized (Java: model, view, controller - XML: activities, content)
