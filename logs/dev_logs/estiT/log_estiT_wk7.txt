What I did this week:
- redid the splash page
- added reset imageview zoom functionality to choosing a map button
- added imageview drag limiting for map so that it will always be on screen
- made the meckenzie map one image view instead of 2 images
- added more image resources
- made campus exterior map view look more centered
- redid links page layout relative layout instead of constraint
- added wifi credentials to the links page and made it scrollable


What I hope to do next week:
- populate the schedule view with events from the back end as soon as the requests are ready

What I struggled with:
- figuring out why the splash page wasnt working
- dealing with constraints
