What I did this week:
- Complete Help Request functionality (pairing with Elisa Kazan)
  - Began integrating Slack with help requests
  - Implement help request notifications using FCM
  - Add server side secret to backend
  - Add token to user object (token is used to communicate between web server,
    FCM, and the device)
  - Add routes to backend for getting the associated help request for a user
  - Use Slack API to get profile picture of mentor along with their full name
  - Add help request complete button
  - Use Slack API to strikethrough message when help request complete
  - Auto updated help requests using broadcasts and FCM

What I hope to do next week:
- Work with team to prepare for D2 demo
- Make my sections of the app prettier
- Help teammates who are still working on their functionality with that

What I struggled with:
- This week was really good. I got a lot done and had a lot of time to do it.
  I enjoyed pairing with Elisa. The only problems I had was that I still felt
  like a lot was being asked of me.
