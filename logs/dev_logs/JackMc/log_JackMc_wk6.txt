What I did this week:
- Team meeting (1.5h)
- Reviewed and paired with various team members on their PRs
- Complete Help Request functionality (pairing with Elisa Kazan)
  - Began integrating Slack with help requests
  - Implement help request notifications using FCM
  - Add server side secret to backend
  - Add token to user object (token is used to communicate between web server,
    FCM, and the device)
  - Add routes to backend for getting the associated help request for a user
  - Use Slack API to get profile picture of mentor along with their full name
  - Add help request complete button
  - Use Slack API to strikethrough message when help request complete
  - Auto updated help requests using broadcasts and FCM
- Completed notification support
  - Notifications view downloads notifications from server
  - Every time we send a notif to the user on the server side, we record it 
    in a Notification object
  - Add a command to the bot, 'announce', that allows an organizer in a 
    specified channel to make an announcement to everyone (via both Slack
    and the app). This sends out an FCM to the topic "announcements"

What I hope to do next week:
- Work with team to prepare for D2 demo
- Make my sections of the app prettier
- Help teammates who are still working on their functionality with that

What I struggled with:
- This week was really good. I got a lot done and had a lot of time to do it.
  I enjoyed pairing with Elisa. The only problems I had was that I still felt
  like a lot was being asked of me.
