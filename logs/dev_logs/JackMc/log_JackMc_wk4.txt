What I did this week:
- Team meeting (1.5h)
- Continued working on help request fragment
- Fixed up model classes on the client side

What I hope to do next week:
- Get the app up and running on Heroku (our cloud server provider) (carried from previous week)
- More work on help request functionality

What I struggled with:
- This week I got a little more focused development done, but people have been
  asking me a lot of questions to unblock their work so that is still a continued
  issue
