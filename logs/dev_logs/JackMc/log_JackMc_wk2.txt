What I did this week:
- Team meeting (1h)
- Work period
- Floated around in work period helping
- Helped Elisa with setting up Android Studio
- Helped Esti with setting up splash page
- Helped Forest with database and controllers for backend

What I hope to do next week:
- Do a little bit more focused development: create routes that we will
  use for mobile app

What I struggled with:
- Setting up the new project was difficult and I'm the most experienced with
  the tools we are using, so I spent most of the week helping others with 
  learning and managing the project instead of doing focused development.
