What I did this week:
- Team meeting (1.5h)
- Team work session(7h)
   - Worked to create specificications for objects to be shared on both client
     and server side
- Began work on help request fragment
- Reviewed team member PRs
- Made classes for the models

What I hope to do next week:
- Get the app up and running on Heroku (our cloud server provider)
- More work on help request functionality

What I struggled with:
- Setting up the new project was difficult and I'm the most experienced with
  the tools we are using, so I spent most of the week helping others with 
  learning and managing the project instead of doing focused development.
