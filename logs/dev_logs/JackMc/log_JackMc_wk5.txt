What I did this week:
- Team meeting (1.5h)
- Split app up into fragments
- Continued working on help request fragment (pairing with Elisa Kazan)
  - Fixed user creation
  - Getting the user ID from the server
  - Submitting the help request
  - Flow for switching fragments when a help request is created (using listeners)
- Reviewed team member PRs
- Got app working on Heroku so server doesn't always have to be running
  locally when developing client-sided code
- Created a class that makes doing JSON-based requests much easier (JsonRequest)

What I hope to do next week:
- Complete help request flow
  - Allow mentor user to +1 message on Slack and have that initiate request 
    state change
  - Use FCM to get message to mobile app user's phone via a FCM notification

What I struggled with:
- Things were much better now team mates are getting used to the technology
  and can work independently. I struggled with learning a new technology (Android
  notifications) so that will have to happen next week
