What I did this week:
- Worked on D3 written portion (design patterns)
- Worked on the powerpoint
- Refactored sections of the code

What I hope to do next week:
- Finish up the app 
- Get D4 done and ready to present
- Make video for D4
- Look into getting the app on the Google Play Store

What I struggled with:
This was a buys week and a lot of the time went towards the deliverables. I wish I had more time to focus on refactoring and makes fixes.
