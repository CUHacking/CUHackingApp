What I did this week:
- Looked for edge cases with help request
- Handled multiple mentors (show names only, no images)
- Handled duplicate mentors
- Modified the schema 

What I hope to do next week:
- Help Esti with the map's user experience
- Change the images to one that covers the entire display 


What I struggled with:
I was pretty pleased with how this week went. I didn't get huge features done but I was able to work on a few little fixes to improve the experience. I had thought about them for a while so I didn't have too much trouble getting them done.
