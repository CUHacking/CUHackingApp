What I did this week:

- Finished the hamburger menu and merged to master
- Create default fragments for each page
- Added a "name" to the events on the backend

What I hope to do next week:
- Regroup with team and see what next task I should work on (potentially notifications or schedule)

What I struggled with:
Getting the hamburger menu to work (followed the Android tutorial)
