What I did this week:
- Team Meeting ~ turned into a work period (1.5h)
- Looked into architectural styles

What I hope to do next week:
- Talk with the group...
    - Get more organized and have more frequent stand ups
    - Make a plan for D2
    - Organize more work periods with 2-3 members

What I struggled with:
This week I struggled with figuring out what needed to be done. Our meeting was turned into a silent work period which was counter productive because we had needed to share what we were all working on and do our weekly standup. This was a bad week which happens sometimes. It was due to personal reasons and lack of communication with out team.
It didn't help that I also struggled with understanding how the server, slack bot and app interact which made figuring what to do next difficult. This week I didn't feel very productive and I really want to improve this in future weeks.
