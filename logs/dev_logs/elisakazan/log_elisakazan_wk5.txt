What I did this week:
- Team Meeting (1.5h)
- Set states for Help Requests (i.e. No Request, Pending Mentor, Mentor Found)
- Layout design for the "Mentor Found" state
- Discussed new design layout for Map tab with Esti
- Approved and commented on multiple PRs
- Added token
- Make client set and update token
- Collaborated with Jack on overall Help Request functionality
- Started creating a list of WBN (Would Be Nice) features

What I hope to do next week:
- Make the notifications look nicer
- Complete Help Request functionality
- Work on D2 document

What I struggled with:
I really enjoyed working with Jack on our tasks, but I found that I got distracted very easily especially when we worked in louder environments and when I had other things on my mind. We had multiple daily stand ups during reading week which was really good because it helped us stay on task.
